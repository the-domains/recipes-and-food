            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Wearable Sun Protection</h1><p>There's no faster way to throw shade on a warm weather vacation (or the first few hot days of spring) than with sunburn.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sevenhugs' Smart Remote</h1><p>Looking to simplify the endless number of apps and interfaces used to control smart-home products, French start-up Sevenhugs has introduced the first "contextually aware" universal Smart Remote.
